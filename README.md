### NASM PROGRAMATION
All the programs are made with the mission to undersntad how the
memory management work in a computer. So it's just the basics for
this little programs.

To compile the programs you only need to:
(yes without the file extension)

`./generate.sh name_file`

#Example 
`./generate.sh hello`

The programs with math (3,4,5) just work with digits and and the
result needs to be also just a digit.

Example
If you try to use the addition program:
---Working---
First number:1
Second number: 8
Result: 8

--Not working--
First number:9
Second Number:9
Result 81 <- The results got to be 1 just one digit
